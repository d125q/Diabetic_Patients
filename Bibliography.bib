                  classification is a well-known, easy and successful method.
                  In this paper we present an extended version of this
                  technique, where the distances of the nearest neighbors can be
                  taken into account. In this sense there is a close connection
                  to LOESS, a local regression technique.  In addition we show
                  possibilities to use nearest neighbor for classification in
                  the case of an ordinal class structure. Empirical studies show
                  the advantages of the new techniques.},
